# ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Prediction & Response Optimization

# Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on **predicting wildfire behavior** and optimizing **response times and resource allocation**.  
Using a dataset of recent Canadian wildfires (26,000+ records, 66 features), the project integrates **predictive modeling, SQL, and Power BI dashboards** to support proactive fire management.  

# Objectives
- Predict wildfire **occurrence and risk levels** using machine learning.  
- Optimize **response times** by analyzing geographic and temporal patterns.  
- Provide decision-makers with **interactive dashboards** for real-time insights.  
- Build an automated **ETL pipeline** from AWS S3 â†’ MySQL â†’ Power BI.  

# Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest)  
- **AWS S3** (data storage & pipeline integration)  
- **Power BI** (data visualization & interactive dashboards)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for modeling analysis  &  ETL

##  Key Results
- **Model Accuracy:** 99%+ (Random Forest & XGBoost)  
- **Operational Insights:** Identified key wildfire risk drivers such as temperature anomalies, wind speed, and low humidity.  
- **Decision Support:** Interactive dashboard for fire risk monitoring and resource allocation.  
- **Automation:** ETL pipeline ensures near real-time data updates from S3 to Power BI.
